# Deep Learning & Neural Network 
A collective experiments on Multi-layer perceptron (MLP), Convolution Nerual Network (CNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), Gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Graph Nerual Network (GNN) to train models for different datasets and tasks. All codes were written in Python.
